        <h1>"Pollution" the threat </h1>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of substances (or energy) that cause adverse changes in the environment and
            living entities .”Pollution need not always be caused by chemical substances such as particulates (like
            smoke and dust). Forms of energy such as sound, heat or light can also cause pollution. These substances
            that cause pollution are called pollutants.Pollution, even in minuscule amounts, impacts the ecological
            balance. Pollutants can make their way up the food chain and eventually find their way inside the human
            body. Read on to explore the types of pollution and their implications.
        <ul>As stated before, there are different types of pollution, which are either caused by natural events (like
            forest fires) or by man-made activities (like cars, factories, nuclear wastes, etc.) These are further
            classified into the following types of pollution:
            <li>Air pollution</li>
            <li>Sound Pollution</li>
            <li>Soil Pollution</li>
            <li>Water Pollution</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Effects of Various Kind of pollution</h1>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Air pollution</b>Air pollution appears to cause or contribute to a variety of health conditions. The
                effects of air pollution on a person’s health can range from mild breathing difficulties to severe
                cardiovascular issues, including heart disease and stroke.Harmful gases and particles in the air come
                from a range of sources, including exhaust fumes from
                vehicles, smoke from burning coal or gas, and tobacco.There are ways to limit the effects of air
                pollution on health, such as avoiding areas with heavy
                traffic. However, significant change relies on improvements to air quality on a global scale.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Water Pollution</b>Water pollutants come from either point sources or dispersed sources. A point
                source is a pipe or channel, such as those used for discharge from an industrial facility or a city
                sewerage system. A dispersed (or nonpoint) source is a very broad unconfined area from which a variety
                of pollutants enter the water body, such as the runoff from an agricultural area. Point sources of water
                pollution are easier to control than dispersed sources, because the contaminated water has been
                collected and conveyed to one single point where it can be treated. Pollution from dispersed sources is
                difficult to control, and, despite much progress in the building of modern sewage-treatment plants,
                dispersed sources continue to cause a large fraction of water pollution problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Soil Pollution</b>It is a serious environmental concern since it harbours many health hazards. For
                example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of contracting
                leukaemia. An image detailing the discolouration of soil due to soil pollution is provided below.
                It is important to understand that all soils contain compounds that are harmful/toxic to human beings
                and other living organisms. However, the concentration of such substances in unpolluted soil is low
                enough that they do not pose any threat to the surrounding ecosystem. When the concentration of one or
                more such toxic substances is high enough to cause damage to living organisms, the soil is said to be
                contaminated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sound Pollution</b>he greatest effect of noise pollution on the environment is on animals. Noise
                pollution can affect an animal's ability to detect acoustic signals, affect courtship behaviors, cause
                birds to produce fewer eggs, and cause fewer offspring to reach reproductive age. On detecting acoustic
                signals, noise can also be produced in the same frequencies in which animals vocalize and can interrupt
                the transmission of information.

                Noise affects many species of animals, from amphibians, arthropods, birds, and fish to mammals,
                mollusks, and reptiles.

        <h1>Reasons of Pollution</h1>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.
            Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat,
            sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or
            naturally occurring contaminants.Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word
            pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created
            by human activities, such as
            manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is
            often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine,
            construction site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as
            microplastics or agricultural runoff).
        <ul>
            <li><b>Air Pollution </b> The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon
                monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.Factories and
                industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These
                are released into the air, degrading its quality.
            </li>
            <li><b>Soil Pollution</b> Industrial activity has been the biggest contributor to the problem in the last
                century, especially since mining and manufacturing have increased. Most industries are dependent on
                extracting minerals from the earth.<br>
                The utilization of chemicals has gone up tremendously since technology has provided us with modern
                pesticides and fertilizers. They are full of chemicals not produced in nature and cannot be broken down.
                As a result, they seep into the ground after mixing with water and slowly reduce the soil fertility.
            </li>
            <li><b>Water Pollution</b>Most Causes of water pollution can be mainly attributed to anthropogenic causes.
                This means humans are responsible for causing water pollution. Water pollution can be defined as the
                introduction of pollutants into a body of water. These can cause detrimental effects on the organisms
                that live in the water body or interact with the water. However, the causes of water pollution can occur
                from natural processes or phenomenon too.Some industries may directly pump their untreated wastes into
                water bodies such as rivers. Moreover,
                various industries also use water as a coolant, thereby causing thermal pollution. Increased water
                temperatures can cause a reduction in the levels of oxygen; which can cause the death of fish and other
                organisms.

                Eutrophication
                Eutrophication is caused when large quantities of nutrients are introduced into a body of water, causing
                the rapid growth of algae. This can decrease the oxygen level in the water, rendering the fish unable to
                breathe. Moreover, this phenomenon can also introduce dangerous toxins into the water body, which can
                harm or kill most organisms, including humans </li>
            <li><b>sound pollution</b>Most of the manufacturing companies and worldwide industries use big machines that
                can produce a large amount of noise. Apart from that, different equipment such as exhaust fans,
                compressors, grinding mills, and many more participate in producing big sound. The wide-ranging exposure
                to high levels of sound can damage the hearing abilities of the workers.Traffic serves as one of the
                major causes of sound pollution as numerous vehicles at the same time on the roads produce heavy noise.
                Apart from it, underground trains, airplanes flying over houses, and other transportation modes make it
                difficult for people to get adapted to high sound..

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>Biomagnification describes situations where toxins (such as heavy metals) may pass through trophic levels,
            becoming exponentially more concentrated in the process.

            Global carbon dioxide emissions by jurisdiction (as of 2015)
            Carbon dioxide emissions cause ocean acidification, the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans as
            CO2 becomes dissolved.
            The emission of greenhouse gases leads to global warming which affects ecosystems in many ways.
            Invasive species can outcompete native species and reduce biodiversity. Invasive plants can contribute
            debris and biomolecules (allelopathy) that can alter soil and chemical compositions of an environment, often
            reducing native species competitiveness.
            Nitrogen oxides are removed from the air by rain and fertilise land which can change the species composition
            of ecosystems.
            Smog and haze can reduce the amount of sunlight received by plants to carry out photosynthesis and leads to
            the production of tropospheric ozone which damages plants.
            Soil can become infertile and unsuitable for plants. This will affect other organisms in the food web.
            Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause acid rain which lowers the pH value of soil.
            Organic pollution of watercourses can deplete oxygen levels and reduce species diversity.
