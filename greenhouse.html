        <h1>Definition of Green House Effect</h1>
        <p>A greenhouse is a house made of glass that can be used to grow plants. The sun’s radiations warm the plants
            and the air inside the greenhouse. The heat trapped inside can’t escape out and warms the greenhouse which
            is essential for the growth of the plants. Same is the case in the earth’s atmosphere.

            During the day the sun heats up the earth’s atmosphere. At night, when the earth cools down the heat is
            radiated back into the atmosphere. During this process, the heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the
            earth’s atmosphere. This is what makes the surface of the earth warmer, that makes the survival of living
            beings on earth possible.

            However, due to the increased levels of greenhouse gases, the temperature of the earth has increased
            considerably. This has led to several drastic effects.

        <h1>Greenhouse Effects on climate change</h1>
        <p>
            Greenhouse gases are gases—like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide—that keep the Earth warmer
            than it would be without them. The reason they warm the Earth has to do with the way energy enters and
            leaves our atmosphere. When energy from the sun first reaches us, it does so mainly as light. But when that
            same energy leaves the Earth, it does so as infrared radiation, which we experience as heat. Greenhouse
            gases reflect infrared radiation, so some of the heat leaving the Earth bounces off the greenhouse gases in
            our atmosphere and comes back to the Earth’s surface. This is called the “greenhouse effect,” in a
            comparison to the heat-trapping glass on a greenhouse.

            The greenhouse effect is not a bad thing. Without it, our planet would be too cold for life as we know it.
            But if the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere changes, the strength of the greenhouse effect
            changes too. This is the cause of human-made climate change: by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere,
            we are trapping more heat, and the entire planet gets warmer..</p>

        <h1>Reasons of Greenhouse Effects</h1>
        <p>The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in a planet's atmosphere insulate the planet from losing
            heat to space, raising its surface temperature. Surface heating can happen from an internal heat source as
            in the case of Jupiter, or from its host star as in the case of the Earth. In the case of Earth, the Sun
            emits shortwave radiation (sunlight) that passes through greenhouse gases to heat the Earth's surface. In
            response, the Earth's surface emits longwave radiation that is mostly absorbed by greenhouse gases. The
            absorption of longwave radiation prevents it from reaching space, reducing the rate at which the Earth can
            cool off.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Burning of Fossil Fuels </b> Fossil fuels are an important part of our lives. They are widely used in
                transportation and to produce electricity. Burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide. With the
                increase in population, the utilization of fossil fuels has increased. This has led to an increase in
                the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
            </li>
            <li><b>Deforestation</b> Plants and trees take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Due to the cutting of
                trees, there is a considerable increase in the greenhouse gases which increases the earth’s temperature
            </li>
            <li><b>Farming</b>Nitrous oxide used in fertilizers is one of the contributors to the greenhouse effect in
                the atmosphere..</li>
            <li><b>Industrial Waste and Landfills </b>The industries and factories produce harmful gases which are
                released in the atmosphere.

                Landfills also release carbon dioxide and methane that adds to the greenhouse gases.</li>

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            It is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere. The main
            cause for this environmental issue is the increased volumes of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and
            methane released by the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from the vehicles, industries and other human
            activities.
            <br>
            Ozone Layer protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. It is found in the upper regions
            of the stratosphere. The depletion of the ozone layer results in the entry of the harmful UV rays to the
            earth’s surface that might lead to skin cancer and can also change the climate drastically.
