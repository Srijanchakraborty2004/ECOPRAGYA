        <h1>Wildfires</h1>
        <p>
            Wildfires are increasing around the globe in frequency, severity and duration, heightening the need to
            understand the health effects of wildfire exposure. The risk of wildfires grows in extremely dry conditions,
            such as drought, heat waves and during high winds.

            Wildfire smoke is a mixture of hazardous air pollutants, such PM2.5, NO2, ozone, aromatic hydrocarbons, or
            lead. In addition to contaminating the air with toxic pollutants, wildfires also simultaneously impact the
            climate by releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>

        <h1>Impact and severity</h1>
        <p>
            The impact of wildfires can have international consequences. The extraordinary wildfires across Canada in
            2023 were the worst in the countryâ€™s history, ravaging an area twice the size of Portugal. The resulting
            smoke and carbon emissions traveled to the United States, turning the skies over New York City orange and
            causing citizens to don face masks due to the horrible air quality (see also air quality index); the smoke
            emanating from Canada caused hazy skies as far south as Florida.</p>

    <div class="para">
        <h1>As Wildfires Increase, Integrated Strategies for Forests, Climate and Sustainability Are Ever More Urgent
        </h1>
        <p>In June 2023, as thousands of wildfires raged in Canada, the skies in New York turned orange with haze and
            smoke. For the first time, New York topped the list of cities with the worst air quality, and health
            advisories were issued advising residents to stay indoors. It was a dramatic reminder that environmental
            crises have no boundaries and should be a concern for us all.

            Every year, from Canada and the United States to the Amazon and the Arctic, across Africa, Asia and Europe,
            wildfires take a heavy toll on the environment and wildlife, as well as human lives and infrastructure. The
            recognized costs of wildfires are usually based on direct economic consequences in the public sector,
            including costs associated with fire suppression, insurance, the loss of assets and, above all, the loss of
            lives. However, wildfires also have broad and long-lasting impacts on social, economic and environmental
            sustainability.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Forest managers should ensure proper forest management practices through tree thinning by removing dry trees
            and branches which act as fuel to fires. They should also have post-wildfire mitigation strategies in place
            such that proper assessment and monitoring is conducted to minimize causes of forest fires, as well as,
            establishment of landscape emergency stabilization plans to reduce sediment and ash transport into open
            water sources. Additionally, forest restoration and rehabilitation on the burnt landscape should be done
            soon after forest fires to minimize pollutants that could be carried from the area.
            Watershed managers should introduce source water protection by having restriction to forests watershed
            having the water sources used for drinking water supply. This way anthropogenic activities that might cause
            forest fires are eliminated. Proper land management practices should be ensured through close monitoring of
            all human activities happening such as logging, mining and residential developments. Also, they should
            implement run-off control measures on the steep landscape such as stream channel erosion controls or using
            wood-straw mulch on burnt area that is being rehabilitated or restored.
            Water Providers should modify their designed treatment infrastructures into robust plants that are able to
            remove pollutants released by forest fires. There should be constant water quality monitoring to understand
            the key pollutant sources considering all burnt areas that could be exposing the pollutants to the water
            reservoirs. Highly optimized treatment processes with highly trained operators having knowledge about
            wildfire water quality impacts should be considered so as to meet drinking water quality standards during
            post-wildfire periods.
