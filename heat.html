        <h1>Heat Waves and Climate Change</h1>
        <p>
            Across the globe, hot days are getting hotter and more frequent, while we’re experiencing fewer cold days.
            In July 2023, Earth broke or tied its record for the hottest day on record, four days in a row. Over the
            past decade, daily record high temperatures have occurred twice as often as record lows across the
            continental United States, up from a near 1:1 ratio in the 1950s.</p>

        <h1>Heatwaves</h1>
        <p>
            Heatwaves, or heat and hot weather that can last for several days, can have a significant impact on society,
            including a rise in heat-related deaths. Heatwaves are among the most dangerous of natural hazards, but
            rarely receive adequate attention because their death tolls and destruction are not always immediately
            obvious. A study found that from 2000–2019 approximately 489 000 heat-related deaths occurred each year,
            including more than 70 000 who died during the 2003 heatwave in Europe.

            Population exposure to heat is increasing due to climate change. Globally, extreme temperature events are
            observed to be increasing in their frequency, duration, and magnitude. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of
            people exposed to heatwaves increased by around 125 million.

            While the effects of heat may be exacerbated in cities, due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, the
            livelihoods and well-being of non-urban communities can also be severely disrupted during and after periods
            of unusually hot weather.

            Heatwaves can burden health and emergency services and also increase strain on water, energy and
            transportation resulting in power shortages or even blackouts. Food and livelihood security may also be
            strained if people lose their crops or livestock due to extreme heat.</p>

        <h1>Climate change made the deadly heatwaves that hit millions of highly vulnerable people across Asia more
            frequent and extreme</h1>
        <p>
            From Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Syria, in the West, to Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines in
            the East, large regions of Asia experienced temperatures well above 40°C for many days. The heat was
            particularly difficult for people living in refugee camps and informal housing, as well as for outdoor
            workers.

            Heatwaves are arguably the deadliest type of extreme weather event and while the death toll is often
            underreported, hundreds of deaths have been reported already in most of the affected countries, including
            Palestine, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and the Philippines. The heat also had a large
            impact on agriculture, causing crop damage and reduced yields, as well as on education, with holidays having
            to be extended and schools closed in several countries, affecting millions of students.

            Extreme heat in South Asia during the pre-monsoon season is becoming more frequent. Two previous World
            Weather Attribution studies focused on extreme heat events in the region: the 2022 India and Pakistan
            heatwave and the 2023 humid heatwave that hit India, Bangladesh, Lao PDR and Thailand. Despite differences
            in the nature and impact of the events (drier heat in 2022 leading to widespread loss of harvest, and humid
            heat in 2023 with greater impacts on people), both studies found that human-induced climate change
            influenced the events, making them around 30 times more likely and much hotter.

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            Across the globe, hot days are getting hotter and more frequent, while we’re experiencing fewer cold days. In
            July 2023, Earth broke or tied its record for the hottest day on record, four days in a row. Over the past
            decade, daily record high temperatures have occurred twice as often as record lows across the continental
            United States, up from a near 1:1 ratio in the 1950s.

            Heat waves are becoming more common, and intense heat waves are more frequent in the U.S. West, although in
            some parts of the country the 1930s still holds the record for number of heat waves (primarily related to
            the Dust Bowl, which was exacerbated by the conversion of prairie to farmland).”

            If greenhouse gas emissions are not significantly curtailed, daily high and low temperatures will increase
            by at least 5 degrees F in most areas by mid-century, rising to 10 degrees F by late century. The National
            Climate Assessment estimates 20-30 more days over 90 degrees F in most areas by mid-century</p>
