    <h1><b>What is climate change?</b></h1>
    <p>
        Climate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions.

        Over the last decade, the world was on average around 1.2C warmer than during the late 19th Century.

        It has now been confirmed that global warming exceeded 1.5C across the 12 month period between February 2023 and
        January 2024. That followed 2023 being declared the warmest year on record.

        The temperature increase was driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather
        phenomenon.

    <h1><b>How are humans causing climate change?</b></h1>
    <p>The climate has changed throughout the Earth's history and natural factors, such as El Niño, can affect the
        weather for shorter periods of time, as happened in 2023.

        But natural causes cannot explain the particularly rapid warming seen in the last century, according to the UN's
        climate body, the IPCC.

        This long-term climate change has been caused by human activity, the IPCC says, mainly from the widespread use
        of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - in homes, factories and transport.

        When fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). This traps extra energy in
        the atmosphere near the Earth's surface, causing the planet to heat up.

        Since the start of the Industrial Revolution - when humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - the
        amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by about 50%, external.

        The CO2 released from burning fossil fuels, external has a distinctive chemical fingerprint which matches the
        type increasingly found in the atmosphere.</p>

    <h1>What are the effects of climate change so far?</h1>
    <p>
        The global average temperature increase of 1.2C seen in the past decade might not sound much.

        However, it has had a huge effect on the environment, including:
    <ul>
        <li>more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall</li>

        <li>rapid melting of glaciers and ice sheets, contributing to sea-level rise</li>

        <li>huge declines in Arctic sea-ice</li>

        <li>ocean warming</li>
    </ul>
    People's lives are also changing.

    For example, parts of East Africa suffered their worst drought in 40 years, putting more than 20 million people at
    risk of severe hunger.

    In 2022, intense European heatwaves led to an abnormal increase in deaths.
