    <h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Effects of Climate changes</h1>
    <p>Climate change is our planet’s greatest existential threat. If we don’t limit greenhouse gas emissions from the
        burning of fossil fuels, the consequences of rising global temperatures include massive crop and fishery
        collapse, the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of species, and entire communities becoming uninhabitable.
        While these outcomes may still be avoidable, climate change is already causing suffering and death. From raging
        wildfires and supercharged storms, its compounding effects can be felt today, outside our own windows</p>
    <h1>Effects of climate change on weather</h1>
    <p>As global temperatures climb, widespread shifts in weather systems occur, making events like droughts,
        hurricanes, and floods more intense and unpredictable. Extreme weather events that may have hit just once in our
        grandparents’ lifetimes are becoming more common in ours. However, not every place will experience the same
        effects: Climate change may cause severe drought in one region while making floods more likely in another.

        Already, the planet has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (1.9 degrees Fahrenheit) since the preindustrial era began
        250 years ago, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). And scientists warn it could
        reach a worst-case scenario of 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 if we fail to tackle the
        causes of climate change—namely, the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas)</p>
    <h1>Effects of climate change on humans</h1>
    <p>Ultimately, the way climate change impacts weather, the environment, animals, and agriculture affects humanity as
        well. But there’s more. Around the world, our ways of life—from how we get our food to the industries around
        which our economies are based—have all developed in the context of relatively stable climates. As global warming
        shakes this foundation, it promises to alter the very fabric of society. At worst, this could lead to widespread
        famine, disease, war, displacement, injury, and death. For many around the world, this grim forecast is already
        their reality. In this way, climate change poses an existential threat to all human life..</p>

                <h3>Sea level Rise</h3>
                <p>Sea level rise refers to the increase in global ocean levels due to climate change, primarily caused
                    by melting glaciers and ice sheets, and thermal expansion of seawater. This rise poses significant
                    threats to coastal ecosystems, cities, and communities, including flooding, erosion, and saltwater
                    intrusion into freshwater sources.</p>

                <h3>Temperature Rise</h3>
                <p>Global temperature rise refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature,
                    primarily caused by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1880, the average temperature has
                    risen by 1.1°C (2.0°F), with the 20 warmest years occurring since 1981, and the top five warmest
                    years since 2016.</p>

                <h3>Intanse Heat wave</h3>
                <p>Intense heat waves refer to prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather, typically exceeding 5-7
                    days, with temperatures significantly higher than average. They can lead to heat-related illnesses,
                    increased mortality, and infrastructure damage. Heat waves are exacerbated by climate change,
                    urbanization, and humidity, posing significant threats to human health and ecosystems.</p>

                <h3>Extreme Weather Events</h3>
                <p>Extreme weather events refer to severe and uncommon weather conditions, such as hurricanes, droughts,
                    floods, wildfires, and heatwaves, that exceed normal variability and cause significant impacts on
                    human life, infrastructure, and the environment. Climate change is increasing the frequency,
                    intensity, and unpredictability of these events, leading to devastating consequences.</p>

                <h3>Longer Wildfire Season</h3>
                <p>A longer wildfire season refers to the extended period of time when conditions are ripe for wildfires
                    to ignite and spread, typically due to drought, heat, and dry vegetation. Climate change has led to
                    an increase in wildfire season length, now often spanning 6-12 months in some regions, posing
                    greater risks to lives, property, and ecosystems.</p>

                <p>An intense cyclone is a powerful, rotating storm with sustained winds exceeding 119 km/h (74 mph).
                    Characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, intense cyclones can cause
                    catastrophic damage, flooding, and loss of life. Climate change is projected to increase the
                    frequency and intensity of these storms.</p>

                <h3>Biodiversity loss</h3>
                <p>Climate change is driving biodiversity loss by altering ecosystems, disrupting species' habitats, and
                    exacerbating extinction risk. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased
                    frequency of extreme events impact species' adaptability, leading to population declines, community
                    shifts, and loss of ecosystem resilience, compromising the health and functionality of ecosystems.

                <p>Climate change is linked to increased mortality through extreme weather events, heat stress, air
                    pollution, and altered disease patterns. Warmer temperatures can lead to cardiovascular and
                    respiratory issues, while extreme events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires cause direct
                    fatalities. Climate-related mortality is projected to rise, disproportionately affecting vulnerable
                    populations.</p>
