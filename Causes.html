    <h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Causes of Climate Change</h1>
    <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other
        greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which has changed the earthâ€™s climate. Natural processes, such as changes
        in the sun's energy and volcanic eruptions, also affect the earth's climate. However, they do not explain the
        warming that we have observed over the last century</p>
    <h1>Does climate change have natural causes?</h1>
    <p>The Earth's climate can be affected by natural factors that are external to the climate system, such as changes
        in volcanic activity, solar output, and the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Of these, the two factors relevant on
        timescales of contemporary climate change are changes in volcanic activity and changes in solar radiation. In
        terms of the Earth's energy balance, these factors primarily influence the amount of incoming energy. Volcanic
        eruptions are episodic and have relatively short-term effects on climate. Changes in solar irradiance have
        contributed to climate trends over the past century but since the Industrial Revolution, the effect of additions
        of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere has been over 50 times that of changes in the Sun's output.</p>
    <h1>Human causes</h1>
    <p>Climate change can also be caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and the conversion of
        land for forestry and agriculture. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, these human influences on
        the climate system have increased substantially. In addition to other environmental impacts, these activities
        change the land surface and emit various substances to the atmosphere. These in turn can influence both the
        amount of incoming energy and the amount of outgoing energy and can have both warming and cooling effects on the
        climate. The dominant product of fossil fuel combustion is carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. The overall effect
        of human activities since the Industrial Revolution has been a warming effect, driven primarily by emissions of
        carbon dioxide and enhanced by emissions of other greenhouse gases.

        The build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to an enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect.
        It is this human-induced enhancement of the greenhouse effect that is of concern because ongoing emissions of
        greenhouse gases have the potential to warm the planet to levels that have never been experienced in the history
        of human civilization. Such climate change could have far-reaching and/or unpredictable environmental, social,
        and economic consequences.</p>

                <h3>Deforestation</h3>
                <p>Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests, usually for human activities like agriculture,
                    urbanization, logging, and mining. It leads to loss of biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion,
                    and water cycle disruption, threatening the environment, wildlife, and indigenous communities.
                    Sustainable forest management is crucial to mitigate its effects</p>

                <h3>Green House Effect</h3>
                <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases (like carbon dioxide, methane, and
                    water vapor) in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, keeping the planet warm enough to
                    sustain life. Human activities have increased these gases, intensifying the effect and leading to
                    global warming and climate change.</p>

                <h3>Industries</h3>
                <p>Industries significantly impact the environment through air and water pollution, greenhouse gas
                    emissions, and resource depletion. Manufacturing processes release toxic chemicals, while extraction
                    and transportation of raw materials harm ecosystems. Additionally, industries contribute to
                    deforestation, habitat destruction, and climate change, affecting biodiversity and human health,

                    overcrowding, poverty, and environmental degradation. As numbers surge, competition for food, water,
                    shelter, and energy intensifies, threatening social, economic, and environmental stability, and
                    necessitating urgent action to address the challenges of a rapidly growing global population.</p>

                    and cooling the planet. Large eruptions can cause temporary global cooling, but increased volcanic
                    activity can contribute to long-term climate change by releasing stored carbon dioxide and altering

                <h3>Ozone Depletion</h3>
                <p>Ozone depletion occurs when ozone (O3) in the stratosphere is destroyed by chlorine and bromine
                    atoms, released from human-made substances like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. This thinning
                    of the ozone layer allows harmful UV-B radiation to reach the Earth's surface, causing skin cancer,
                    cataracts, and ecosystem damage.

                <h3>Moutaintop Mining</h3>
                <p>Mountaintop mining is a practice where the tops of mountains are removed, allowing for almost
                    complete recovery of coal seams while reducing the number of workers required to a fraction of what
                    conventional methods require. Mountaintop mining can involve removing 500 feet or more of the summit
                    to get at the buried seams of coal. The earth from the mountaintop is then moved into neighboring
                    valleys.</p>
