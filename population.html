        <h1>Definition of Overpopulation</h1>
        <p>Human overpopulation (or human population overshoot) describes a concern that human populations may become
            too large to be sustained by their environment or resources in the long term. The topic is usually discussed
            in the context of world population, though it may concern individual nations, regions, and cities.

            Since 1804, the global human population has increased from 1 billion to 8 billion due to medical
            advancements and improved agricultural productivity. Annual world population growth peaked at 2.1% in 1968,
            and has since dropped to 1.1%According to the most recent United Nations' projections, "[t]he global
            population is expected to reach 9.7 billion in 2050 and 10.4 billion in 2100.other researchers have found
            that national birth registries data from 2022 and 2023 that cover half the world's population indicate that
            the 2022 UN projections overestimated fertility rates by 10 to 20% and are already outdated, that the global
            fertility rate has possibly already fallen below the sub-replacement fertility level for the first time in
            human history, and that the global population will peak at approximately 9.5 billion by 2061.

        <h1>overpopulation effects on climate change</h1>
        <p>

            Earth’s average temperature is higher than at any point in recorded history, with new temperature records
            now being set on a regular basisThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that human
            emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, have raised the
            global average temperature by 1.1°C (2°F) above pre-industrial levels.To limit the risks posed by climate
            change, countries around the world agreed to hold the average temperature increase well below 2°C, aiming
            for a 1.5°C threshold [13]. If current warming trends continue, the Earth’s average temperature increase is
            likely to reach 1.5°C by the 2030s. Global warming above this level would significantly increase the
            risk and frequency of extreme weather events and damage to many of the planet’s terrestrial and marine
            ecosystems .

            Holding the temperature rise to 1.5°C involves fundamentally changing the processes that produce the most
            greenhouse gas emissions, especially burning fossil fuels for energy, industry, and transportation. A global
            energy transition involving using energy more efficiently, generating it from renewable sources, such as
            solar and wind, and electrifying transportation would reduce emissions from coal, oil, and natural gas. This
            is especially relevant for high polluting areas such as the United States, Europe, China, and India .
            Stopping forest loss, planting new forests, reducing food waste, and managing land to conserve soil carbon
            also are additional important steps to limit warming for both the industrial and developing countries.</p>

        <h1>Reasons of overpopulation</h1>
        <p>Overpopulation is an undesirable condition where the number of the existing human population exceeds the
            actual carrying capacity of Earth. Overpopulation is caused by a number of factors. Reduced mortality rate,
            better medical facilities, depletion of precious resources are few of the causes which result in
            overpopulation. It is possible for a sparsely populated area to become densely populated if it is not able
            to sustain life.

            Growing advances in technology with each coming year has affected humanity in many ways. One of these has
            been the ability to save lives and create a better medical treatment for all. A direct result of this has
            been the increased lifespan and the growth of the population.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Increased birth rate and decline death rate</b>At the root of overpopulation is the difference
                between the overall birth rate and death rate in populations. If the number of children born each year
                equals the number of adults that die, then the population will stabilize. Talking about overpopulation
                shows that while there are many factors that can increase the death rate
                for short periods of time, the ones that increase the birth rate do so over a long period of time.</li>


            <li><b>Immigration to a new ecological niche with fewer predators</b>Many people prefer to move to developed
                countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, where the best facilities are available in terms of
                medical, education, security, and employment. The result is that those people settle over there,
                eventually making those places overcrowded. the number of people who are leaving the country is less
                than the number of people who enter, it
                usually leads to more demand for food, clothes, energy, and homes.</li>



            <li><b>Better medical facilities</b>Following this the industrial revolution started. Technological
                advancement was perhaps the biggest reason why the balance has been permanently disturbed.Science was
                able to produce better means of producing food, which allowed families to feed more mouths.
                Besides, medical science made many discoveries, thanks to which they were able to defeat a whole range
                of diseases.Illnesses that had claimed thousands of lives until now were cured because of the invention
                of vaccines.
                Combining the increase in food supply with fewer means of mortality tipped the balance and became the
                starting point of overpopulation.</li>

            <li><b>Poverty</b>However, when talking about overpopulation, we should understand that there is a
                psychological component as well. Poverty is considered as the leading cause of overpopulation. In the
                absence of educational resources, coupled with high death rates, which resulted in higher birth rates,
                that is why impoverished areas are seeing large booms in population.</li>

            <li><b>Family planning</b>Most developing nations have a large number of people who are illiterate, live
                below the poverty line, and have little or no knowledge about family planning. Besides, getting their
                children married at an early age increases the chances of producing more kids.

                Those people are unable to understand the harmful effects of overpopulation, and lack of quality
                education prompts them to avoid family planning measures.</li>

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            The effects of overpopulation are quite severe. The first of these is the depletion of resources. The Earth
            can only produce a limited amount of water and food, which is falling short of the current needs.

            Most of the environmental damage seen in the last fifty-odd years is because of the growing number of people
            on the planet. They include cutting down forests, hunting wildlife in a reckless manner, causing pollution,
            and creating a host of other problems.

            Those engaged in talks about overpopulation have noticed that acts of violence and aggression outside of a
            war zone have increased tremendously while competing for resources.
