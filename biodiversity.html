        <h1>Biodiversity loss, a risk for the environment and for humanity</h1>
        <p>
            The planet's biodiversity is under threat and the main culprit is the one who, paradoxically, depend on it
            most: human being. Slowing down biodiversity loss, understood as the reduction or disappearance of the
            variety of living beings that inhabit the planet, is one of humanity's great challenges. Below, we review
            the causes, consequences and possible solutions.
            The Aichi Targets, part of the Strategic Plan for Biological Diversity (2011-2020) established by the United
            Nations Environment Program (UNEP), were due to be met by the year 2020. This road map set 20 targets to
            slow down the destruction of the planet's biodiversity, but ten years later, as the report points out, none
            of these commitments is likely to be fully met, with the consequent negative impact on species, ecosystems
            and human beings themselves.

        <h1>Causes of Biodiversity Loss:</h1>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Natural biodiversity loss</b>An area’s biodiversity increases and decreases with natural cycles.
                Seasonal changes, such as the onset of spring, create opportunities for feeding and breeding, increasing
                biodiversity as the populations of many species rise. In contrast, the onset of winter temporarily
                decreases an area’s biodiversity, as warm-adapted insects die and migrating animals leave. In addition,
                the seasonal rise and fall of plant and invertebrate populations (such as insects and plankton), which
                serve as food for other forms of life, also determine an area’s biodiversity.

                Biodiversity loss is typically associated with more permanent ecological changes in ecosystems,
                landscapes, and the global biosphere. Natural ecological disturbances, such as wildfire, floods, and
                volcanic eruptions, change ecosystems drastically by eliminating local populations of some species and
                transforming whole biological communities. Such disturbances are temporary, however, because natural
                disturbances are common and ecosystems have adapted to their challenges (see also ecological
                succession).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Human-driven biodiversity loss</b>In contrast, biodiversity losses from disturbances caused by humans
                tend to be more severe and longer-lasting. Humans (Homo sapiens), their crops, and their food animals
                take up an increasing share of Earth’s land area. Half of the world’s habitable land (some 51 million
                square km [19.7 million square miles]) has been converted to agriculture, and some 77 percent of
                agricultural land (some 40 million square km [15.4 million square miles]) is used for grazing by cattle,
                sheep, goats, and other livestock. This massive conversion of forests, wetlands, grasslands, and other
                terrestrial ecosystems has produced a 60 percent decline (on average) in the number of vertebrates
                worldwide since 1970, with the greatest losses in vertebrate populations occurring in freshwater
                habitats (83 percent) and in South and Central America (89 percent). Between 1970 and 2014 the human
                population grew from about 3.7 billion to 7.3 billion people. By 2018 the biomass of humans and their
                livestock (0.16 gigaton) greatly outweighed the biomass of wild mammals (0.007 gigaton) and wild birds
                (0.002 gigaton). Researchers estimate that the current rate of species loss varies between 100 and
                10,000 times the background extinction rate (which is roughly one to five species per year when the
                entire fossil record is considered). In addition, a 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
                Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services noted that up to one million plant and animal species
                are facing extinction due to human activities.

        <h1>Biodiversity - our strongest natural defense against climate change</h1>
        <p>Biological diversity — or biodiversity — is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and
            bacteria to entire ecosystems such as forests or coral reefs. The biodiversity we see today is the result of
            4.5 billion years of evolution, increasingly influenced by humans.

            Biodiversity forms the web of life that we depend on for so many things – food, water, medicine, a stable
            climate, economic growth, among others. Over half of global GDP is dependent on nature. More than 1 billion
            people rely on forests for their livelihoods. And land and the ocean absorb more than half of all carbon
            emissions.

            But nature is in crisis. Up to one million species are threatened with extinction, many within decades.
            Irreplaceable ecosystems like parts of the Amazon rainforest are turning from carbon sinks into carbon
            sources due to deforestation. And 85 per cent of wetlands, such as salt marshes and mangrove swamps which
            absorb large amounts of carbon, have disappeared.

    <div class="para">
        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            The weight of biodiversity loss is most pronounced on species whose populations are decreasing. The loss of
            genes and individuals threatens the long-term survival of a species, as mates become scarce and risks from
            inbreeding rise when closely related survivors mate. The wholesale loss of populations also increases the
            risk that a particular species will become extinct.

            Biodiversity is critical for maintaining ecosystem health. Declining biodiversity lowers an ecosystem’s
            productivity (the amount of food energy that is converted into the biomass) and lowers the quality of the
            ecosystem’s services (which often include maintaining the soil, purifying water that runs through it, and
            supplying food and shade, etc.).

            Biodiversity loss also threatens the structure and proper functioning of the ecosystem. Although all
            ecosystems are able to adapt to the stresses associated with reductions in biodiversity to some degree,
            biodiversity loss reduces an ecosystem’s complexity, as roles once played by multiple interacting species or
            multiple interacting individuals are played by fewer or none. As parts are lost, the ecosystem loses its
            ability to recover from a disturbance (see ecological resilience). Beyond a critical point of species
            removal or diminishment, the ecosystem can become destabilized and collapse. That is, it ceases to be what
            it was (e.g., a tropical forest, a temperate swamp, an Arctic meadow, etc.) and undergoes a rapid
            restructuring, becoming something else (e.g., cropland, a residential subdivision or other urban ecosystem,
            barren wasteland, etc.).</p>
