        <h1>Definition of Ozone Deplation</h1>
        <p>Ozone layer depletion is the thinning of the ozone layer present in the upper atmosphere. This happens when
            the chlorine and bromine atoms in the atmosphere come in contact with ozone and destroy the ozone molecules.
            One chlorine can destroy 100,000 molecules of ozone. It is destroyed more quickly than it is created.

            Some compounds release chlorine and bromine on exposure to high ultraviolet light, which then contributes to
            ozone layer depletion. Such compounds are known as Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS).

            The ozone-depleting substances that contain chlorine include chlorofluorocarbon, carbon tetrachloride,
            hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and methyl chloroform. Whereas, the ozone-depleting substances that contain
            bromine are halons, methyl bromide, and hydro bromofluorocarbons.

            Chlorofluorocarbons are the most abundant ozone-depleting substance. It is only when the chlorine atom
            reacts with some other molecule, it does not react with ozone.

            Montreal Protocol was proposed in 1987 to stop the use, production and import of ozone-depleting substances
            and minimise their concentration in the atmosphere to protect the ozone layer of the earth.

        <h1>Climate Changes for Ozone Deplation</h1>
        <p>
            Reduced ozone levels as a result of ozone depletion means less protection from the sun’s rays and more
            exposure to UVB radiation at the Earth’s surface. Studies have shown that in the Antarctic, the amount of
            UVB measured at the surface can double during the annual ozone hole.

            Ozone layer depletion increases the amount of UVB that reaches the Earth’s surface. Laboratory and
            epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes non-melanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in
            malignant melanoma development. Of the human health effects from sun exposure, melanoma is the most lethal,
            causing nearly 7,000 deaths annually in the United States. In addition, UVB has been linked to the
            development of cataracts, a clouding of the eye’s lens.</p>

        <h1>Reasons of Ozone Layer Deplation</h1>
        <p>Ozone layer depletion is a major concern and is associated with a number of factors. The main causes
            responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer are listed below:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Chlorofluorocarbons</b> Chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs are the main cause of ozone layer depletion.
                These are released by solvents, spray aerosols, refrigerators, air-conditioners, etc.

                The molecules of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere are broken down by ultraviolet radiations and
                release chlorine atoms. These atoms react with ozone and destroy it.
            </li>
            <li><b>Unregulated Rocket Launches</b> Researches say that the unregulated launching of rockets results in
                much more depletion of the ozone layer than the CFCs do. If not controlled, this might result in a huge
                loss of the ozone layer by the year 2050.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Natural Reasons</b>The ozone layer has been found to be depleted by certain natural processes such as
                Sun-spots and stratospheric winds. But it does not cause more than 1-2% of the ozone layer depletion.
            </li>

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            In a report published every four years on the progress of the Montreal Protocol, the panel confirmed the
            phase-out of nearly 99 per cent of banned ozone-depleting substances.

            The Montreal Protocol was signed in September 1987 and is a landmark multilateral environmental agreement
            that regulates the consumption and production of nearly 100 man-made chemicals, or ‘ozone-depleting
            substances’ (ODS).

            The overall phase-down has led to the notable recovery of the protective ozone layer in the upper
            stratosphere and decreased human exposure to harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun.

            “The impact the Montreal Protocol has had on climate change mitigation cannot be overstressed,” said Meg
            Seki, Executive Secretary of the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Ozone Secretariat.

            “Over the last 35 years, the Protocol has become a true champion for the environment. The assessments and
            reviews undertaken by the Scientific Assessment Panel remain a vital component of the work of the Protocol
            that helps inform policy and decision-makers.”

            In a tweet on Tuesday, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the restoration of the ozone
            layer was "an encouraging example of what the world can achieve when we work together".
