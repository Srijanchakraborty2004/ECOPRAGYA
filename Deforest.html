        <h1>Deforestation and the carbon cycle</h1>
        <p>
            Forests store large amounts of carbon. Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as
            they
            grow. This is converted into carbon and stored in the plant’s branches, leaves, trunks, roots and in the
            soil.

            When forests are cleared or burnt, stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, mainly as carbon dioxide.
            Averaged over 2015—2017, global loss of tropical forests contributed about 4.8 billion tonnes of carbon
            dioxide
            per year (or about 8-10% of annual human emissions of carbon dioxide).

            Whilst forests are important carbon sinks, meaning they draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the
            carbon
            stored in these sinks is part of an active, relatively quick carbon cycle. As living things (including
            trees)
            die and decay, the carbon that they once stored is released back into the atmosphere.

            By contrast, carbon stored underground in the form of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, is much more
            stable, and is part of a much slower carbon cycle. Without the influence of humans burning these fossil
            fuels
            for energy, this carbon would be unlikely to reach the atmosphere. When fossil fuels are burned, carbon from
            dead and decayed plants, animals and phytoplankton that lived hundreds of millions of years ago (before
            dinosaurs existed), is released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.</p>

        <h1 >Deforestation and climate change</h1>
        <p>
            Burning fossil fuels, in combination with destruction of carbon sinks due to deforestation and other
            activities,
            has contributed to more and more carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere – more than can be absorbed
            from
            existing carbon sinks such as forests. The build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is driving global
            warming, as it traps heat in the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels are now at their highest in human
            history.

            It is not effective to “offset” greenhouse gas pollution from burning fossil fuels by storing carbon in
            forests.
            This is because fossil fuels are pumping much more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than existing forests
            can
            absorb. At the same time, carbon stores in forests and other natural carbon sinks will become increasingly
            unstable as climate change progresses. Droughts, tropical storms, heatwaves and fire weather are increasing
            in
            severity and frequency because of climate change. This will continue to result in increases in forest
            losses,
            contributing to more and more carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. Risks are significantly
            reduced
            but not avoided by keeping the rise in global temperature well below 2°C.</p>

        <h1>Reasons of Deforestation</h1>
        <p>‘Forest loss’ or ‘tree loss’ captures two fundamental impacts on forest cover: deforestation and forest
            degradation.

            Deforestation is the complete removal of trees for the conversion of forest to another land use such as
            agriculture, mining, or towns and cities. It results in a permanent conversion of forest into an alternative
            land use. The trees are not expected to regrow. Forest degradation measures a thinning of the canopy — a
            reduction in the density of trees in the area — but without a change in land use. The changes to the forest
            are often temporary, and it’s expected that they will regrow.
           From this understanding, we can define five reasons why we lose forests:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Commodity-driven deforestation </b> is the long-term, permanent conversion of forests to other land
                uses such as agriculture (including oil palm and cattle ranching), mining, or energy infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li><b>Urbanization</b> is the long-term, permanent conversion of forests to towns, cities, and urban
                infrastructure such as roads.</li>
            <li><b>Shifting agriculture</b> is the small- to medium-scale conversion of forest for farming, which is
                later abandoned so that forests regrow. This is common in local subsistence farming systems where
                populations will clear forest, use it to grow crops, and then move on to another plot of land.</li>
            <li><b>Forestry production </b>is the logging of managed, planted forests for products such as timber,
                paper, and pulp. These forests are logged periodically and allowed to regrow.</li>
            <li> <b> Wildfires</b> destroy forests temporarily. When the land is not converted to a new use, forests can
                regrow in the following years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>The future</h1>
        <p>
            Protecting natural ecosystems and sustainably managing and re-establishing forests are important ways to
            reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions and slow down temperature rise in the short term by drawing down carbon dioxide
            from
            the atmosphere. At the same time, we must deeply and rapidly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions levels
            from
            fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas. If we do only the former and not the latter, we risk transforming more and
            more of our carbon sinks into carbon sources as climate change progresses.</p>
